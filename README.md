I used MetaFlop font tool to design the “Adjuster” font.  

1. I set a larger x-height (the height of lowercase letters). This improves legibility for young children as it makes lowercase characters more prominent. 

2. I kept relatively wide spacing between characters. It allows their eyes to move more comfortably between characters. 

3. As a programming font role too, I kept the design with the clarity of brackets, semicolons, and other symbols. The font is well spaced which makes them clear even in small sizes.
